Welcome!

First off, please understand that I build addons based on my personal needs. But that means I build them for me. I think my needs align with a lot of peoples' needs, but they won't always. Where there's a conflict, I build addons for me. (=

And while I really do like building addons, I really don't love hunting down obscure bugs -- especially not when those bugs require me to install and fuss with other addons that I don't already use.

Burning a day figuring out how those other addons work so I can track down the conflict is a special kind of hell. And more often than not, the outcome is that I can't fix the issue since I can't control how other addons work.

Testing GogoLoot is inherently a bit of a pain, since I have to be in a raid, and I have to be Master Looter. I don't really want to make a habit of asking 40 people to pause the raid so I can fix your bug, y'know? That's asking a lot.

Anyway all that said, feel free to leave feedback. Just know that my response is almost always going to be, "No, sorry. I can't do that." 

Cheers!
